# airsonic-scripts

Some script I am using to run AirSonic-Advanced at home

This should work with any AirSonic based release. 

It works with a standalone (aka manual) installation on Debian based distros (I am running Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS)

# WARNING

I have NOT tested my installation script yet. It is based on my upgrade script and all the commands I ran to install airsonic in the first place.

# Feedback
Yes, please give me some feedback on this :)
